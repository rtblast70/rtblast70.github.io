        I chose software engineering in hopes of joining two of my passionsâ€” bringing people together and using electronics. 
        I started my degree not with the knowledge of how to write a print statement, but with hopes that the effort dedicated 
        to my goals will one day make the world better in some way.

        In my journey thus far I have broadened my experience and worldview, 
        brought engineering students of all backgrounds together, and (this is crucial) learned to code. 
        Now, I am looking to further utilize the skills that I have learned to make a positive impact on 
        more people through the many applications of software engineering.
